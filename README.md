# Boop-Game

This is a simplified version of the boop game, created using javaScript, HTML and CSS. It is a 2 player game,
where the names of the players, number of kittens, grid size and points needed to win
have to be specified before starting the game. In order for a player to gain a point, 3 of the same
kittens have to be alligned. Although, in order to win the game a player must gain the specified points or place all 
kittens on the grid. Note that if a kitten is placed next to another
it will push the other kitten to the neighbouring available cell and kittens can
be pushed off the grid but in such a case the kitten will return to the bench. You can download a .txt file 
containing the data of the most recent wins.
